# urlShortener

To run application, have local server and local mysql running. Run composer install, php artisan migrate, php artisan serve.

Challenge was making the project in laravel. I have worked with PHP before but without using frameworks. I went with laravel bevause of everything that comes with composer and to make the http request secure. 

I made a simple UI just to show the functionality. 

Futute improvements will definently be in the UI/UX, I did use bootstrap to make sure is mobile responsive but would like to add more css and javascript for other DOM manipulations.
